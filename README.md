# Udacity Animal Trading Card Project

My favourite animal card design project for completion of [Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001?v=fe1).

## Project Description

Created a simple interactive card presenting one of the most majestic beings on this planet - Eagles.
Designed using mainly HTML & CSS.
